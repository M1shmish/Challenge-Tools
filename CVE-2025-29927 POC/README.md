# Exploit code for CVE 2025-29927

This is a simple pyhton script I made to help me with a CTF.
It exploits a critical severity vulnerability in next.js middleware which is very easy to exploit.
The exploitation can also be achived using curl command with the -H flag.
You can use this script to check if you are vulnerable or to solve a CTF. :P
I hope you find this script helpful in any way.

**Usage:**

```python CVE-2025-29927.py {URL}```


**Optional**

You can uncomment the library "render_html" that renders the html output on a web browser dynamically without saving the file.
