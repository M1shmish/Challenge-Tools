# Exploit code for CVE 2025-29927

This is a simple pyhton script I made to help me with a CTF.
It exploits a critical severity vulnerability in next.js middleware which is very easy to exploit.
The exploitation can also be achived using curl command with the -H flag.
You can use this script to check if you are vulnerable or to solve a CTF. :P
I hope you find this script helpful in any way.

**Usage:**

```
python CVE-2025-29927.py -F/-EX/-EN -u {URL} -d {path/to/wordlist} -m {status codes to mute}

-EX, --explit      Only test exploitation on URL and show output HTML. (default)
-EN, --enum        Enumerate without exploiting.
-F,  --full-run    Run exploitation and enumeration together.
-u,  --url         Target URL (required).
-m,  --mute        Response codes to mute (comma and/or space separated, e.g. -m 301,302 404)
-d,  --dictionary  Path to dictionary wordlist (required for -EN or -F)
```

**Optional**

You can uncomment the library "render_html" that renders the html output on a web browser dynamically without saving the file.
